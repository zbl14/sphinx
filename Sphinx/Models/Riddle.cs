      {"Day and Night", "There are two sisters: one gives birth to the other and she, in turn, gives birth to the first. What are they?"},
      {"Sun", "Never resting, never still; moving silently from hill to hill; it does not walk, run or trot; all is cool where it is not. What is it?"},
      {"Hummingbird","As small as your thumb, I am light in the air. You may hear me before you see me, but trust that I'm here. What is it?"},
      {"Tree","In spring I am gay in handsome array; in summer more clothing I wear; when colder it grows, I fling off my clothes; and in winter quite naked appear. What is it?"},
      {"Memory","What can bring back the dead; make you cry, make you laugh, make you young; is born in an instant, yet lasts a lifetime."},
      {"Moon","What is always old and sometimes new; never sad, sometimes blue; never empty, but sometimes full; never pushes, always pulls?"},

      {"Death", "Some try to hide, some try to cheat; but time will show, we always will meet. Try as you might to guess my name."},
      {"River", "What can run, but never walks; has a mouth, but never talks; has a head, but never weeps; has a bed, but never sleeps?"},
      {"Fish", "I'm alive, but without breath; I'm as cold in life as in death; I'm never thirsty, though I always drink. Who am I?"}
